Project Name: “The Guessing Game”
Summary: 
The server generates a number between 1 and 2  and asks the user to guess which number is generated within a set time. If the user gets it right, then the server adds 1 to their score and they move on to the next level. 

Every level up increases the range of numbers generated by 1 (Ex. Level 2 will generate numbers between 1 and 3) and reduce the amount of time given.

This goes on until the user guesses the number wrong. Their score is displayed, and they are told if they set a new record or not. The record is displayed on-screen while the game is being played and only changes when a new record is set.

Functional Requirements:

 Main Menu:
-Music is played when the site is opened
-A main menu is displayed with the options to start the game or to view how to play
-When clicking on how to play, the page changes to show the rules and an option to return back to the main menu

During the game:
 -Once the game is started, the user will be taken to a screen showing the level and the range of numbers they will have to guess in
 -The level screen displays how many lives the user has
 -A random number generator where the range of numbers is able to change (increasing with the level) will be used to generate a number that the user has to guess
-An input box will be in the center of the screen for the user to input their guess

If the user guesses the number:
    -They are shown the next level
    -They are shown the new number range
    -They are sometimes given an extra life if they are below the max

If the user fails to guess the number:
    -They lose a life and are told if the number is higher or lower and then to guess again

If the user runs out of lives:
    -They are taken to a "game over" screen
    -The level they made it to is displayed
    -Their score is displayed next to their previous score and highest score
    -They are told if they got a new record
    -They are given the option to return to the main menu
