Project Name: “The Guessing Game”
Summary: 
The server generates a number between 1 and 2  and asks the user to guess which number is generated within a set time. If the user gets it right, then the server adds 1 to their score and they move on to the next level. 

Every level up increases the range of numbers generated by 1 (Ex. Level 2 will generate numbers between 1 and 3) and reduce the amount of time given.

This goes on until the user guesses the number wrong. Their score is displayed, and they are told if they set a new record or not. The record is displayed on-screen while the game is being played and only changes when a new record is set.

Functional Requirements:
-A Menu will be displayed when the page is first opened, clicking a button will start the game
-The game will use a random number generator where the range of random numbers is able to change (increasing with the level), and this range will be displayed and changed each level
-The user will be able to input numbers
-The user's score will be tracked and displayed
-The program will track the user's highest score
-The level the user is on will be tracked and displayed (likely same information as score)
-There is a timer that will count down and cause the game to end when it reaches 0
-A game over screen is displayed when the user loses, also displaying their score

Functional Requirements depending on theme:
-There is a health system / number of lives that decreases when the user guesses the wrong number
-Music plays as the game is being played and it will work with the clock to create stress
-The user's scores from all previous attempts are displayed
