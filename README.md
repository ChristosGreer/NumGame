Project Name: “The Guessing Game”
Summary: 
The server generates a number between 1 and 2  and asks the user to guess which number is generated within a set time. If the user gets it right, then the server adds 1 to their score and they move on to the next level. 

Every level up increases the range of numbers generated by 1 (Ex. Level 2 will generate numbers between 1 and 3) and reduce the amount of time given.

This goes on until the user guesses the number wrong. Their score is displayed, and they are told if they set a new record or not. The record is displayed on-screen while the game is being played and only changes when a new record is set.

Functional Requirements:
-A Menu / State before the game has been played
-A random number generator where the range of random numbers is able to change
-A way to track score
-A way to track the player’s record
-A display for the level
-A clock / way to track time passed / a timer feature
-Sound for timer countdown


(Potentials, depending on theme)
-A display for health / number of lives and a way to track / change it
-A way to play music / clock sound?
